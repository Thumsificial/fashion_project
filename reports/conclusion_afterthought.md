## Conclusion and Afterthought

After the project was finished I was left with some thoughts. It had been harder to work with the data than I expected, and most of my time working with the project has been spent playing with the data and not the models themselves. And it was hard to make the data into the shape that would fit my ideas, especially when there were a lot of it.

There is also a lot more I wanted to do with it. I didn't submit any results to any of the competitions I worked on, because in the H&M competition I didn't get a model that could predict what the competition was looking for, and the shopee I didn't really understand the submission format. I was not happy about this, because I wanted to get the feeling of working toward the top of the competition leaderbord, which might not be realistic, but it was a goal for me.

Also the chatgpt outfit recommender I wanted to do more with, like creating a nice application around it, or using it further to find the specific clothing pieces that it gave.

However I am left with a new sense of interest in the field of deep learning and fashion, and there seems to be a lot of very relevant areas to explore here, both with recommendation based on style and also the AR aspect that I discovered during the discovery phase.

I also feel like I have learned a lot about working with different types of data, and even if I struggled with some things, it ended up being a fun adventure.
