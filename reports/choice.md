## Choice

With the many different routes to take with this project, it was hard to choose one, but using the H&M dataset would let me explore the processes of creating a recommendation engine.

However before that, I wanted to work on style recommendation, and what better to use for that than the chatgpt api.

After playing a bit with the chatgpt api, I started to work with the H&M fashion recommendation dataset from the kaggle competiton.

The H&M dataset proceded to be a real struggle for me, so after a while I wanted to test out something new. The shopee competition is not as much fashion recommendation in the same way that the H&M competition was. But it is still relevant to some interesting points.

There are lots of different sites out that sells the same items for different prices. Some sites buy white label items, while the whole trend of dropshipping is still popular. This does not make it easy to know if you are getting ripped of or a real deal.

Also some fast fashion brands like Shein are getting accused of stealing designs, and this could really be transparent with a good way of comparing articles to each other.
