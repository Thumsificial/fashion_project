## Discovery phase
I had some ideas about what i wanted to discover with this project, however I chose to start with an open mind, looking for what is relevant with fashion recommendation and machine learning.

The data sets provided by the task indicated two directions I could take the project. Fashion recommendation based on previous purchases with the data from the H&M kaggle competition, or item comparison with the data from the kaggle shopify competition. However I wanted to understand a bit about the relevant use of machine learning in the fashion and retail industry today.

After searching around, I discovered that there were multiple interesting ways machine learning is used to help the industry, both concerning retail and the fashion creation aspect.

The fashion creation industry is using ai to analyze and create new clothes. However this to me seems like an interesting, but complex direction to go.

The fashion retail industry seems interested in using ai to both increase sales by recommending the right items, and also use various of ways to reduce shipping waste when ordering online.

The H&M dataset provided in the task is an example of using ai to predict future purchases, and can be used for recommending the right items by analysing purchase history.

The right item is not only about the type of item recommended, but there is also a problem with online shopping, where the fact that you are unable to try on the size and fit of the item, makes buying items a bit of a gamble, where people either order multiple sizes of the same item to keep only the right size, or having multiple orders, because the sizing was wrong or the item was not as expected. This leads to lots of extra shipping.

Some companies like 3DLOOK is trying to solve this, by using ai in combination with ar, to have a try on solution, where you can use your phone or webcam to viritually try on the clothes before ordering them, thus being able to judge both the sizing of the clothes, as well as outfitting the clothes and seeing the fit.

This type of solution is also used shops like Specsavers, where you are able to try on the glasses with an ar solution online, before buying them.

Waste can also come in the form of excess clothes that are not bought. So machine learning can also be used to analyze the sizing of clothes bought, as well as sizing feedback, to make the clothes produced have better sizings, and also see what sizes are bought more, to adjust the production to better fit the need.
